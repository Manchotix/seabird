## notes

The above code alters each original colour scheme in the following ways:

- comments are removed
- theme names are changed
- colours are switched
- the cursor background colour is adjusted
- the font for the current line number is adjusted
- the status line font and background colour are adjusted
- a comment block is appended, crediting the themes upon which seabird is built
