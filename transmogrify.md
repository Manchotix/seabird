These are the Vim commands applied to the 'flattened' colour scheme files in order to transmogrify them into the seabird files.

The seabird colour scheme files found in this repository are generated from:

- [`flattened_light.vim`](https://github.com/romainl/flattened/blob/master/colors/flattened_light.vim) commit 86656af
- [`flattened_dark.vim`](https://github.com/romainl/flattened/blob/master/colors/flattened_dark.vim) commit 86656af

## notes

The above code alters each original colour scheme in the following ways:

- comments are removed
- theme names are changed
- colours are switched
- the cursor background colour is adjusted
- the font for the current line number is adjusted
- the status line font and background colour are adjusted
- a comment block is appended, crediting the themes upon which seabird is built
